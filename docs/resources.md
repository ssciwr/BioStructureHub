We offer a range of resources from general structure prediction methods to specialized tools. These can be accessed on your local computer, using cloud solutions, or in high-performance computing environments.

## Tools

* General models: We offer support in using and interpreting the results of general approaches such as  [AlphaFold3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w) or [Boltz-1](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.624167).

* For specialized tasks beyond the capabilities of general methods we offer custom solutions, to find the best model for your project!


## Infrastructure

* Cloud computing: We offer support and share best practices around the existing cloud computing options, such as the [AlphaFold3 server]( https://alphafoldserver.com/ ) or the [ProteinAI service](https://protein-ai.academiccloud.de/) for Boltz-1 and AlphaFold2.

* High Performance Computing: AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 are available on the [bwForCluster Helix](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Helix). We offer assistance and training for cluster usage.
