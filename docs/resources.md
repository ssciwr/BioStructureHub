We offer a range of resources from general structure prediction methods to specialized tools. These can be accessed on your local computer, using cloud solutions, or in high-performance computing environments.

## Tools

* General models: We offer support in using and interpreting the results of general approaches such as  [AlphaFold3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w) or [Boltz-1](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.624167).

* For specialized tasks beyond the capabilities of general methods we offer custom solutions, to find the best model for your project!


## Infrastructure

* Cloud computing: We offer support and share best practices around the existing cloud computing options, such as the [AlphaFold3 server]( https://alphafoldserver.com/ ) or the [ProteinAI service](https://protein-ai.academiccloud.de/) for Boltz-1 and AlphaFold2.

* High Performance Computing: AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 are available on the [bwForCluster Helix](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Helix). We offer assistance and training for cluster usage.

Are you new to the world of bioinformatics and not sure where to start? Don't worry, we've got you covered! The EMBL-EBI offers an excellent resource for beginners with their online course ["Bioinformatics for the terrified"](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/bioinformatics-terrified/). This course provides broad overview of how computers are used in biology, covering the basics and beyond. It's the perfect starting point for anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of bioinformatics. 

For a light introduction to protein structure prediction, an overview on the history of AlphaFold and its first appearance in the CASP competition, and more, we recommend checking out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_fHJIYENdI) by Veritasium on Youtube. 

Among other courses in the area of bioinformatics,  the EMBL-EBI also offers more specialized training with their course [Alphafold2](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/). This course goes into the practical aspects of structure predictions, providing hands-on experience and expert guidance. If you prefer video formats, there is a great [talk by Simon Kohl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTN0MM2CQLU) during the heidelberg.ai series on Youtube talking about the model and concepts behind AlphaFold 2.

For information on the latest release of AlphaFold, a detailed tutorial on AlphaFold 3 can be found on the [AlphaFold Server](https://alphafoldserver.com/guides). Note that you need a Google account to access the content.
