The Bio-Structure Hub will give an introduction to 3D structure prediction using the open-source software [Boltz](https://boltz.bio/) on **6 November 2025**, **3 pm**. Additionally, there will be a clinic on protein structure visualization with [Pymol](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page) and various analysis tools.
