## Consultations 
The first step is to get in touch with us - our services are free of charge. When you request a consultation, it is helpful if you provide the following information:
  
* the type of biomolecule(s) you are interested in
* the embedding of the molecules
* the outcome that you would like to predict.

The initial consultation takes about one hour. In this initial consultation, we clarify further aspects and then suggest an approach moving forward: Either providing you with resources, or investigating your question for you in a small-scale project.

## Small-scale projects 
Small-scale projects offer about a week of work. This could be a small development script, feedback to existing software, or small structure prediction projects. Small-scale projects are the result of a consultation.

## Long-term collaborations
For larger projects we offer collaborations by training any member of your team. We offer continuous support and resources for independent work. Such a collaboration is also a result of a consultation.

## Support of your third-party funded projects
When you apply for funding at an agency, you can also request further resources from the Bio-Structure Hub either as personnel or as a service.
