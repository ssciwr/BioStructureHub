We provide software development and scientific support with structure predictions of biomolecules.
Get in touch with us to see if we can help you!

## Consultations
The first step is to get in touch with us - our services are free of charge. When you request a consultation, it is helpful if you provide the following information:
  
* the type of biomolecule(s) you are interested in
* the scientific question you want to address

The initial consultation takes about one hour. In this initial consultation, we clarify further aspects and then suggest an approach moving forward: Either providing you with resources, or investigating your question for you in a small-scale project.

## Project support
Following up on a consultation, projects can receive support. This could be a small development script, feedback to existing software, or entire prediction projects. 

## Collaboration
Recurring support requests in the same project can lead to a longer-term collaboration. We support third-party funding applications.

## Training
For larger projects we also offer collaborations by training any member of your team. We offer continuous support and resources for independent work. This includes advice on how to find and use appropriate resources such as documentation, software and pipelines.

## Teaching
Best practices and guides will be collected in tutorials and (virtual) coursework.
This includes applications and support in providing routes to access and use compute resources for bio-structure predictions.
