# Welcome to the Bio-Structure Hub


With the availability of general structure prediction models like AlphaFold or Boltz, researchers are provided with powerful tools to excel their research.
The Bio-Structure hub aims to aid researchers in the use of structure prediction models. 

Located at the Scientific Software Center at the IWR Heidelberg, our focus lays on sustainable software and reproducible science. We aim to bridge the gap between wet lab research and *in silico* predictions. 

The Bio-Structure Hub is funded by the [Klaus-Tschira Stiftung](https://klaus-tschira-stiftung.de/).
